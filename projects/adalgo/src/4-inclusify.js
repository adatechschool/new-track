/**
 * This function tries to use french inclusive notation instead of masculine or feminine gender in sentences.
 * *This is a simplified version that focuses on simple pronouns replacement.*
 * The function should :
 * - replace il, elle by iel
 * - replace ils, elles by iels
 * - replace ceux, celle by celleux
 * Be carreful to properly handle edge cases from tests.
 * @param {string} text
